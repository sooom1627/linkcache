# Project Brief: Knowledge Triage & Growth Space

# Project Brief: Knowledge Triage & Growth Space

## 1. Vision & Purpose
A platform where individuals and teams can intuitively filter information, align knowledge, and visualize their growth.
* **Mission:** Reduce decision fatigue and transform "saved links" into visible personal progress.
* **Core Philosophy:** Shifting from "passive hoarding" to "active triaging."
* **Strategy:** Build in Public, prioritizing rapid development and scalability.

## 2. Core Mechanism: The Triage Flow
Instead of just saving links, users "triage" them through a card-based Swipe UI.

1.  **Inbox:** A temporary holding area where all new links land.
2.  **Triage (Swipe UI):**
    * **Swipe Right (Read Soon):** Move to "Read Soon" or a specific Collection.
    * **Swipe Left (Later):** Save for later. Removes it from the immediate view.
3.  **Action:** Read the "Read Soon" list and mark as "Completed" to see progress.


## 3. MVP Scope Definition

### Phase 1.0: Core Triage Experience (Must-Haves)
* **URL Entry:** Manual paste of a URL into the app.
* **OGP Engine:** Automatically fetch Title and Thumbnail Image (Copyright-compliant: store metadata only).
* **Swipe UI:** Card-stack interface for Inbox sorting (Read Soon vs. Later).
* **Reading List:** A simple list view of "Read Soon" items.
* **External Reading:** Tapping a link opens it in the system's default browser.
* **Authentication:** Basic Sign-up/Login via Supabase Auth.
* **Collections:** Flexible workspaces (Many-to-Many: one link can be in multiple collections).
* **Growth Dashboard:** * Counters for Inbox, Read Soon, and Completed items.
    * Activity Log: Visualization (e.g., bar chart) of links processed/read over the last 7 days.
* **Manual "Read" Toggle:** Mark links as "Completed" to track actual learning.

## 4. Out of Scope for MVP
* **Share Extension:** No "Share to app" from external browsers (Phase 2).
* **In-app Reader:** No clutter-free mode (Always open external browser).
* **AI Summary:** No automatic text summarization for now.
* **Team Features:** No shared collections or social feeds (Single-player first).
* **Advanced Features:** No full-text search, offline access, or link health checks.

## 5. Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** React Native / Expo (Prioritize high-performance Swipe UI).
* **Backend/DB:** Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Real-time sync).
* **Data Schema Highlights:**
    * `links`: id, url, title, image_url, created_at.
    * `link_status`: user_id, link_id, status (inbox, read_soon, later), triaged_at, read_at.
    * `collections`: id, name, user_id.
    * `collection_links`: collection_id, link_id.

## 6. UX Principles
* **Zero-Gravity:** Minimal friction between saving and triaging.
* **Confidence-Driven:** Focus on "what I have learned" rather than "what I have to do."
